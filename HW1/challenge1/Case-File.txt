Case File:

An unothorized user has inserted themselves into the database!

1. You don't get a name list.

2. The names are all, however, guaranteed to be in the dictionary.txt.

3. You also do not have the luxury of getting a UUID namespace upfront.

4. Only some of the passwords are in the dictionary.txt.

These reason you have any passwords at all is that some users did not
follow company protocol for password creation and therefore are a security
risk, one you will need to exploit. Don't worry, the company has mandated
that its users update their passwords immediately, and so anything you
find will by now be obsolete.

The user who last logged in at 05:04 UTC on February 14th has a file
with the UUID namespace, presumably in lieu of a sticky note. The
company provided the file as part of its cooperation, but does not keep
any plaintext passwords on hand. You already asked. This file is encrypted
using the same password as this user's account, because this user has
once again refused to follow company policy and used the same password
in multiple places.

You need to reverse engineer the database to the point that you get the
password associated with this user, and use that password to open their file.

You should now have the list of usernames as well.

The user with the username "Chirico" has found the password of the
unauthorized user and has prepared a file encrypted with the HH:MM:SS
section of their last login time (but set to the timezone for Istanbul,
Turkey, where some of the users work remotely). Once you have found
this user's name, you have found the clue you are looking for, and can
proceed in your investigation elsewhere. Make sure to take good notes!
